# Taco Cloud
A Java web app built with the Spring framework where users can order custom-made tacos from a model taco restaurant.

### Features
- Data persistence to a MySQL database using Spring Data Jpa
- User registration, authentication, and authorization using Spring Security
- A front-end built with Thymeleaf, HTML and CSS

### What I learned
This project made me familiarize with the Spring framework and the MVC design pattern. I really enjoyed seeing what goes into building a complete web app. Working on this project gave inspiration to various new project ideas for me to build! ðŸ˜„
